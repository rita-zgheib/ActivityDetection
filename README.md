# ActivityDetection

This is the first version of the activityDetection application, used to validate the semantic message oriented middleware architecture.

In this project we use 3 main libraries:
- jgrove for gathering sensors raw data
- MQTT protocole as a message oriented middleware
- RDF4J for ontology management and SPARQL query analysis

This project is on progress...

Till now you can run SemanticBedPressureSensor as a semantic sensor and publisher
and the PressureSubscriber.

I am working on the wearingClothes-App as a virtualSemanticSensor (subscriber and publisher at the same time)
